   We created a new database (storefront2) for this second part of the django course.
   - We made the necessary adjustments in the database section of the settings file.
   
   - We install application dependencies:
        pipenv install

    - Here, I face this problem: The instructor had developed this project using an older version of python (3.9).
        So, at first I tell virtual environment which version i am going to use:
        pipenv --python 3.12
        then
        pipenv install

        Note the following note I took in the first part of the course:
            at this point, the instructor told us to do "pipenv install mysqlclient" but my
            terminal kept giving errors every time i tried to install mysqlclient. So instead, i
            installed "pipenv install pymysql" and import it in __init__.py file which is in the
            same folder with settings.py
    
    - to activate environment => pipenv shell
    
    - python manage.py migrate
        Tables are created in the database (storefront2) according to our models

    - We load the data to database using seed.sql file the instructor supplied:
        File => Open SQL Script => Select file => click on the lightning bolt icon
        python manage.py migrate
    
    python manage.py createsuperuser
