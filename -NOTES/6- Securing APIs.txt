- Token-based Authentication
  
  Token-based authentication is de facto standart for authenticating users with RESTful APIs.



- Adding the Authentication Endpoints

  Django comes with a full-fledged authentication system. 
  But this system doesn't include an API layer. So we don't have any endpoints for users to register,
  login, so on. We only have a bunch of models and database tables. 
  We can build this API layer by hand. But that's pretty tedious and repetitive.
  We don't want to repeat it in every project.
  So this is where we use a fantastic library called 'Djoser'. Djoser is the RESTful implementation 
  of Django authentication system. It provides a bunch of views for user registration, login, logout,
  password reset, and so on.
